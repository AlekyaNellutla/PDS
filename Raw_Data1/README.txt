1. The data set contains 5 different attributes: Height(Inches), Weight(Pounds), Age, Grip strength, Frailty.

2. Here we are trying to build a predictive model for the data set.

3. As data pre-processing is important and is the second stage, on observing the data the dependent variable Frailty is binary.

4. Frailty have N and Y values, we should change them to 0's and 1's so that the overall data will be in integers.

5. One of the understandable model for binary classification is Logistic regression and we are using it here to do the analysis.

6. Data pre-processing and model building is under the SRC folder.
